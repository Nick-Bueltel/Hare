# Hare - The text editor that hates you

# Getting Started.
 * Hare will be deployed as an electron app - fully cross platform of course

 # Target Audience 
 * Hare is for people who want a silly text editor to mess with. It will not be particularly useful for anything, other than frustration. 

# Current MVP 
* the main purpose of Hare is to frustrate its users, the following features are considered MVP 
    * Save files in a random and un-usefull way such as 
        * Scrambled 
        * all caps 
        * reversed
        * double every letter in the document
        * Mirrored 
    * replace common hotkeys with non user friendly ones
        * command + z = delete this file 
        * command + c = copy this text backwards
        * command + v = paste copied text as copied
        * command + a = select two random letters 
        * command + x = cut selected text..... scrambled
    * load files as normal
    * "helpful" dialogue boxes that appear at random during typing, interrupting said typing. 
        * did you know? that hare doesnt like you very much? 
        * have you ever seen a man eat his own face? 
        * when will you get the hint that hare is not for you?
        * only real programmers use hare to write their code
        * Hare will never sell your data to anyone, we promise. 

# Technologies Used
* electron 
* React.js
* human spite 

# Ice Box 
* further frustrating features.
    * awful formatting that changes on occasion without input from the user
    * mandatory saves, it will actually stop the user from typing until they save 
    * 
* a nice mode that actually works as a normal editor would, however this will take an extensive hotkey to enable. maybe the konami code.
